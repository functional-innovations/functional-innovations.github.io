I"S<p>Some recent projects use ppg components, the performance requirements are lenient, the main things to shoot for is ease-of-use and cost efficiency. As a trend, integrated synchronized bio-potential sensing is a plus for extensibility. The text book method is to add analog channels capable of high input impedance, this is in contrast to the typical case where PPG uses TIA which offers limited input impedance. It takes effort to massage the specifications into the design window using TIA fixated topology.</p>

<p>Although it is nice to have synchronized high impedance channels, however the techniques and sampling schemes may be different between optical and bio-potential use cases, combining them may yeild sub-optimal performance for each specifically. For example, choice of ADC, a SDC (vs SAR) offers noise shaping, and sampling rate, where PPG implementations may desire to reduce sampling rate to lower power consumption, however for bio-potential frontend higher sampling rate typically yields better anti-aliasing when there are particular considerations, it typically already have higher bandwidth requirement vs optical. Additonally certain PPG integrated bio-potential implementation may push antialiasing further up-front, this may happen when preamps are time shared and inputs are connected and or held at specific time slots via input matrices - such that adding more components to manage defies the logic of integration.</p>

<p>Current drain in most cases are dominated by LED drive and duty cycle, it is nice to see lower quiescent consumption in general, though system integration should be carried out with a holistic view.</p>

<p>PPG implementations are tricky in the sense that, electrical signal quality is heavily dependent on mechanical design and use conditions, when reading datasheet one should pay attention to details and inspect the claims. Things such as motion artifact maybe a limiting factor in the real world.</p>

<p>This time we are allowed some bandwidth to explore. Modules are great, MAXIM, AMS and ADI all have some nice offerings. On discretes, there are a few AFEs we are learning about - these should be somewhat new, commercially readily available, and less expensive:</p>

<h3 id="ams-as7026">AMS AS7026</h3>

<p>The as7026 is a popular module solution from the IC fab AMS. Huami uses this part widely in their newer main stream wearables. It also integrates synchronized bio-potential channel. The complete dataset can be found below.</p>

<h3 id="ti-afe4900">TI AFE4900</h3>

<p>The afe4900 component from TI is an interesting contender. It also offers high impedance channels in addition to optical sensing. It interests us due to its relatively lower price. However, currently we can only read the abridged version of the datasheet, and waiting on TI to grant access to the full version. It is interesting to note that, all TI’s PPG AFEs only have abridged datasheet online, it requires special permission to learn about these parts.  Not sure about the reason, it does seems admistrative: perhaps support is limited? In comparason, we have used their ADS129x series bio-potential AFEs for over a decade, never has this limitation, and did not ask for support either. Nevetheless, the abridged datasheet can be found here.</p>

<h3 id="maxim-max861xx">MAXIM MAX861XX</h3>

<p>Maxim has many <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/sensors/healthcare-sensor-ics/optical-health-sensors.html">offerings</a>, they have been selling an integrated module <a href="https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX86150.pdf">max86150</a> for some time. Maxim’s ppg solution has been popular in the market.  On another note, their newer bio-potential part looks very good and has a well supported eco system, here a link on the <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/data-converters/analog-front-end-ics/MAX30003.html">max30003</a>. For optics, the MAX86141 is main stream, here is the full dataset.</p>

<h3 id="adi-adpd4000">ADI ADPD4000</h3>

<p>This looks to be an interesting part. It does offers some added flexibility, for example, pre-biasing, differential channels, various input and integration and or cancellation schemes, and lots of configuration options. One might be able to achieve something unique with this part. Here is a link to the full data sheet.</p>

<p>Photo diodes (PD) and LEDs are equally if not more important for a good PPG implementation. For a start, we only mentioned few AFEs in this blog. There are many more items and choices to consider. We will capture additional aspects in subsequent notes.</p>
